## Get Started


Sakhir is a social media banking app for F1 Racing fans, powered by Nostr - a new decentralized protocol that enables truly open, censorship-resistant communication.

- Nostr uses ultra-secure cryptographic key technology that can't be compromised.

- 100% anonymous. we don't require any of your data such as email(s) or phone number(s).

- Follow users with a familiar Twitter UI people have come to expect.

- You own your data - we keep **BIG TECH** out of your life.

- No one can manipulate posts you see or share with followers.

- Receive Bitcoin from anyone in the world with built-in support for Lightning Addresses. (ex: you@sakhir.me)

It's the easiest way to start accepting Bitcoin for payments without having to be online all the time.

## Get Started


Sakhir is a social media banking app for F1 fans in Bahrain powered by Nostr - a new decentralized protocol that enables truly open, censorship-resistant communication.

- Nostr uses asymmetric key cryptography that can't be compromised.
- 100% anonymous - your NSEC key is your ID - no email or phone number required!
- You own your data - we collect no user data and keep Big Tech out of your life!
- Follow users with familiar Twitter UX fans have come to expect.
- No one can manipulate posts you see or share with followers.
- Receive Bitcoin from anyone in the world with built-in support for non-custodial Lightning Addresses.
Ex: you@sakhir.me

Lightning Addresses are your gateway to perfect money - it's the easiest way to start accepting Bitcoin for payments without having to be online all the time.
